## Uninstall Previous Versions

### Highly recommended!

1. Download our Community Version Launcher from [our website](https://elefrac.com/)
2. Launch the installer and follow the installation instructions.
3. Launch the `GameLauncher.exe`.
   - Select the folder where your Spellbreak files are installed, or choose a new installation folder for the Community Version.
4. The Launcher will download the game and the necessary mod files.
5. Once finished, click the "Start" button to launch the game.

**If you're having issues with the installer, reference the [Manual Setup section](#b-manual-setup---only-conduct-the-steps-below-if-the-launcher-is-not-working-for-you).**

## Connecting to Our Servers

Elemental Fracture hosts several dedicated servers for NA and EU, including Solos, Duos, Squads, and other game modes. To connect to a server:

1. On the main menu, replace the default server address (`127.0.0.1:7777`) with the IP address of the Elemental Fracture server you want to join.
2. You can find the latest server IPs in our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/elefrac).
3. If you prefer not to join the Discord, we've also added our servers here: 

**North America (NA): Beauharnois QC, Canada:**
- NA Solos: 15.235.112.186:7777
- NA Duos: 15.235.112.186:7778
- NA Squads: 15.235.112.186:7779
- NA Arenas/TDMs: 15.235.112.186:7780

Feel free to use these servers for your brawls and battles! However, please be considerate when using them for 1v1 matches within our community. During times of high demand or leading up to public events, we encourage you to host your own server to ensure smooth gameplay for all participants. Happy gaming!
