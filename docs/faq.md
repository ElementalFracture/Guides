## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Why's my game laggy/choppy/unplayable?
It's likely you didn't install the Balance Patch To install a patch, navigate to your game's root directory (where the .exe is located) and follow the path `g3/Content/Paks/`. Simply drag and drop the downloaded file into this folder. There's also a helpful video attached below.

### Why can't I connect to one of the servers?
If you're having trouble connecting, check out these steps:
1. Make sure you add the correct port `:7777` after the IP address, like this: `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:7777`. Other servers use 7778, 7779, 7780, so make sure you're using the right port for your game server. You can find all of this info in the [setup guide](guide.md). 
2. If you've already tried this, double-check that the server isn't already in use. The Pink Marla bot shows the players across each server.
3. The server may be temporarily down.
4. Though it's not explicitly mentioned, consider if your firewall is blocking the Spellbreak Community Version. Microsoft Support provides guidance on configuring your firewall [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/firewall-network-protection-in-windows-security-aef9838b-d081-fd75-3b1b-e5fa794c003b).

### How do I host a server?
For instructions on hosting your own server, consult the guide on [how to host a server](hosting.md). It provides comprehensive details on the process.

### My friend can't connect to my hosted server. What could be the issue?
If your friend can't connect to your hosted server, consider these potential solutions:
1. Verify that you've correctly forwarded your port. While we can't offer direct support for this, consult your router's user manual or watch a YouTube tutorial. Confirm your port is open using a tool such as [canyouseeme.org](https://canyouseeme.org/) with your IP address and port `7777` while the server is running. A green checkmark indicates success.
2. Check your firewall settings.

### Can I use the server to play with my friends, or to play alone?

Certainly! You're welcome to use the server for 1v1 matches and Battle Royale, as long as you're not the only player in that game mode. Please be considerate of other players who may want to use the server. If both servers are occupied and you wish to play 1v1 or Battle Royale with one or two friends, consider hosting your own server for a smoother experience.

### Help! I can't open the console!
If you're having trouble opening the console:
1. Make sure you're pressing the correct key, which is the tilde key (`~).
2. If you don't see the tilde key on your keyboard, your keyboard layout might not be in a generic English (EN) layout. You can use the Virtual Keyboard, available in Windows, with the EN layout.

### Can I mod the game or make changes?
Absolutely! Elemental Fracture has already introduced balance patches, and you can learn how to install these patches in the [setup guide](guide.md). Please note that if you have additional mods installed, you won't be able to play on Elemental Fracture as the conflict between our servers and your client would probably make for an unplayable experience.
