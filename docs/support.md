# Support Elemental Fracture
---

At Elemental Fracture, we're committed to keeping the game completely free for everyone. You’ll never be asked to contribute financially to enjoy the game—we believe in making it accessible to all, without barriers. That said, if you’re passionate about supporting our growing community, we gladly welcome any contributions to help us maintain and improve our server infrastructure. All funds collected are dedicated solely to expenses like server infrastructure and website. Our dedicated team, who are involved in support, development, moderation, and leadership roles, volunteer their time, talents, and efforts.

Your generosity goes directly towards ensuring the best possible experience for all players, but rest assured, playing the game will always remain free. Whether or not you choose to support us financially, we deeply appreciate your presence in our vibrant community. 

If you'd like to support us, you can visit our Patreon [here](https://patreon.com/elementalfracture). Every bit of support helps us continue to build and grow!
