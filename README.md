# Welcome to Elemental Fracture. We're so glad you're here.

On January 9, 2023, at 10:23 PST, the Spellbreak servers were officially shut down, marking the sunset of the game. However, a **community version** of the game was released to the public at the same time, which allowed some members of the community to pick up the reigns and create the community Discord Elemental Fracture. Several **weekly events** and regular **daily** games are run on private servers, allowing the community to continue dropping into the Hollowlands. This version grants access to all cosmetics and talents from the current (Chapter 3) and previous patches (pre-alpha, alpha, beta, and chapters 1-3).

Elemental Fracture emerged from this unique moment in Spellbreak's history. Our mission is simple yet powerful: we want to bring our Spellbreak community together to resurrect the game we love. Whether you're a seasoned pro who has been part of Spellbreak's journey from the beginning or someone discovering this captivating game for the first time, we wholeheartedly welcome you to our community. Here, friendships are made and flourish, skills sharpen, and the passion for Spellbreak burns brighter than ever. Join us on this exciting adventure of reviving this wonderful game.
